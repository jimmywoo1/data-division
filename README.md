# Effects of Data Division Methods on Model Performance
It is widely used in practice to subset the dataset randomly using predetermined ratios when splitting the dataset into
training and testing sets. However, This may lead to issues, having a training set that does not optimally represent
the testing set. In this report, various data division methods were explored, applying clustering algorithms in
preprocessing to generate a training set that better represents the testing set than a traditional random split. It was
shown that the training sets identified from these clustering algorithms helped reduce issues related to overfitting.
